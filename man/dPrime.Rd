\title{Calculating d-prime (d')}
\usage{
dPrime(oldRating, ratings, oldNew, oldNewLevels = c(0, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{oldRating}{A value indicating the code for the remember response.}

\item{ratings}{A vector contatining the codes for the know responses.}

\item{oldNew}{An vector coding whether an item was new/not-studied or old/studied.}

\item{oldNewLevels}{An vector containing  possible levels of old_newInformation. The first value or level is for new/not-studied 
items and the second value is for old/studied items. Defaults to c(0,1).}
}
\value{
The function returns a value for d'.
}
\description{
This function caculates the dimensionless statistic d-prime (d').
To do this, the percentage values are converted to z-values with the help of inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of the Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. 
Or as a equation:
\deqn{d' = z(hit rate) - z(false alarm rate)}
where \eqn{z(p), p in [0,1]} is the inverse Gaussian CDF.
