#' Calculating response bias (c)
#' 
#' This function calculates the response bias (c).
#' To do this, the (log-linear transformed if transformation = TRUE) percentage values are converted to z-values with the help of inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF)
#' of the Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. 
#' Or as a equation:
#' \deqn{c =  -0.5 * (z(hit rate) + z(false alarm rate))}
#' where \eqn{z(p), p in [0,1]} is the inverse Gaussian CDF.

#' @param oldRating Values corresponding to 'old' responses.
#' @param transformation Logical indicating to choose a log-linear transformation following Snodgrass & Corwin (1988). Default is TRUE. 
#' @param ratings A vector containing all responses.
#' @param oldNew An vector containing whether an item was new/not-studied or old/studied.
#' @param oldNewLevels An vector containing  possible levels of old_newInformation. The first value or level is for new/not-studied 
#' items and the second value is for old/studied items. Defaults to c(0,1).
#' @return The function returns a value for response bias (c).
